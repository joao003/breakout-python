This is Breakout game made fully in Python with Pygame library. This is created to show my skills that I learned from CS50. The objective of this game is to break all the bricks available in the level in order to pass to next level.

# Controls
* Arrow keys - Move paddle
* Spacebar - Launch sphere
* P - Pause/Resume game

# Known bugs
* Sphere can be stuck on right side of screen sometimes. The solution is let it fall off.

# Requirements
* Python must be installed and up-to-date.
* Pygame must be installed
* Windows 10 64-bit or later (Never tested on Windows 7 and 8.1. Recent version of Python doesn't support Windows 7, but Windows 8.1 may work)
* Also works on updated modern Linux distros made from 2020 onwards with [WineHQ](http://www.winehq.org).
